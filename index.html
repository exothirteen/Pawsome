      <h2>Do dogs know their name?</h2>
      <p>Yes, many dogs can learn to recognize and respond to their names. Dogs are capable of learning verbal cues and associating them with specific meanings, including their own names. When a dog hears its name repeatedly in association with positive experiences, such as receiving treats or affection, it can form an understanding that the sound refers to itself. This recognition may not be as complex as human understanding, but it's often sufficient for dogs to respond when called by name.</p>
